(all absolute addresses on a S-size dog map with a 3-character name, unless otherwise stated)
 
List of bytes
Left - byte number. Everything done on a size map S o
three-character name (they move). WoGowy map format, unless selected.
 
0000 to 0003 - map version, depends on the format - WoG (33), AB (15), RoE (0e), SoD (1c). This is also checked by the H3 map editor
0004 - on some maps it indicates if there are players on the map; in the case of WoG maps with ERMs, it does not work
0005 to 0008 - length / width of the map side
0009 - whether the map has dungeons (01) or not (00) - note - if the map has dungeons, then the bytes describing the terrain on the surface are followed by the second as many with the description of the underground
000a to 000d - length of the map name (the editor allows up to 30 characters)
000e - the first character of the map name
-attention - from now on we assume a map name with a length of 3 characters! -
0011 to 0014 - length of the map description
-attention - from now on we assume that the map has a description with a length of 0 characters! -
0015 - easy map difficulty (00); normal (01); hard (02); expert (03); impossible (04)
0016 - hero level limitation
0017 - the beginning of the description of the players; if a given player cannot be played, his description starts with two zero bytes; if a player cannot be played or has no heroes, its description takes 15 bytes; if he has one hero, then 25 bytes, if more, then 5 bytes for each additional one + any names (described in more detail below) (heroes' houses are not included in the number of player's heroes)
-attention - when a given player does not appear on the map, some bytes describing him may take random values
008E to the last byte of player descriptions (if missing)
008f to the win condition (FF - standard, 00 - known artifact, 01 - collect a squad, 02 - get a resource, 03 - expand the city, 04 - build a grail, 05 - defeat a specific hero, 06 - conquer a city, 07 - defeat a specific monster, 08 - flag the habitats, 09 - flag the mines, 0a - transport the artifact); if non-standard, additional bytes follow (see description below)
0090 to the failure condition (FF - standard, 00 - loss of a specific city, 01 - loss of a specific hero, 02 - time limit); if non-standard, additional bytes follow (see description below)
0091 to the number of teams; if non-zero, then 8 additional bytes describing the team numbers of the next players (team numbers start with 0) / we assume in the numbering that there are no teams /
0092 to 00a5 - information about which heroes are available for the game (20 bytes, for RoE 16)
00a6 to 00a9 - four nulls (reserved for potential new heroes? Appearing from AB)
00aa - number of disposed heroes, then for each:
* 1 - Hero ID
* 1 - hero portrait number (FF is standard)
* 4 name length (0 - standard
* [] name
* 1 - which players can buy this hero (bit field, 87654321)
*

00aa - no matter what, GrayFace says they are Disposed Heroes, but he didn't want to figure it out. Most regular maps have null here and no extra bytes, but some do show up. Pathology put aside for later. They appear from SoD.
00ab to 00c9 - 31 nulls
00ca to 00db - information about which artifacts are available (18 bytes, up to AB including 17)
00dc to 00e4 - information about which spells are available (from SoD inclusive)
00e5 to 00e8 - information about which heroes' skills are available (from SoD inclusive)
00e9 to 00ec - number of rumors (maximum 30) (if different from zero, to additional bytes (see below) (bytes 00ea to 00ec always equal to zero - are they not used for something else (?) (Rather not))
further 156 bytes corresponding to information about predefined heroes (all heroes are 156)
if for which character the byte is true, additional flags appear, is there any specific non-standard information:
* experience
* secondary skills
* artifacts
* biography
* sex
* witchcraft
* first-class skills

If any of these flags is true, then the appropriate information appears behind it, the form is identical to that of the hero's object (instance)

Then follow:
- terrain description (see further) - 7 bytes per field
- defs declarations (see further) - 4 bytes for their number, and then for each (4 + length_name + 42) bytes
- descriptions of all objects on the map (see further) - 4 bytes for their number, then depending on the objects
- time events (see further)
- variables depending on who knows what, are probably just for the sake of deception


0189 - start of terrain hexes (as there are no rumors)
From now on, the descriptions of the next fields of the terrain follow.
After the last field, there are bytes that define the number of defs.
eight bytes after it begins with the name of the first def. Do these eight
bytes is the limit on the number of defs per map ??? see the names of defs precedes (04 00 00 00)
deficit of items used on the map
def consists of name length + name + 42 bytes of description
 
the list of objects is followed by the list of defects
First is the number of objects (4 bytes) (including monsters)
objects follow
for each object used object 12 bytes
1 byte - X factor
2 byte - coefficient y
3 byte - level - (00) overground, (01) underground
4 byte - object identifier (probably the number in the defa order that defines it (according to the order of defs from previous declarations))
5 - 12 ??
 
(FF) and 3 bytes empty - why here ??
 
monsters and objects follow
Each monster is defined by 24 bytes (or 36 ?????)
objects are usually 10 bytes (such as artifacts and resources)
1 byte - X factor
2 byte - coefficient y
3 byte - level - (00) overground, (01) underground
4 byte - object identifier (probably the number in the defa that defines it)
 
-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- -------
Notes about the area:
The area code is the descriptions of the following fields, in stripes from left to right, a
then top down (surface first, then dungeon). Each field consists of 7 bytes.
1 byte - terrain type - dirt (00), desert (01), grassland (02), snow
(03), swamp (04), rough (05), subterranean (06), lava (07) water (08)
2 byte - the appearance of the terrain - the image number in the definition
3 byte - river presence - water (01), icy (02), mud (03), lava
(04); none - (00)
4 byte - river direction / appearance - picture number in def
(vertical (09), (0a); level (0b), (0c); turn (01); intersection (04);
leg plumb _ | _ (05); branch level (07); none - (00) ;;; sometimes (00)
also when there is a river (why?) - DP turn)
 
5.6 byte - roads (check out later), probably analogous to rivers
 
7 byte - whether the byte is a coast and whether (and, if necessary, how) the bitmap with the field should be mirrored

coast adds 40 to this bit field

change of the map field caused by this byte:
we look at the 2 least significant bits (we take the number modulo 4)
if we have 00 (like 00 or 40 for example) then we leave the graphic alone
if we have 01 (as for example 01 or 41), then we mirror the image symmetrically with respect to the vertical axis:
			|
			|
	-----------------
	|		|		|
	|		|		|
	|		|		|
	|		|		|
	|		|		|
	|		|		|
	-----------------
			|
			|<-the axis we reflect against
			|
if we have 02 (as for example with 02 or 42), then we mirror the image symmetrically with respect to the horizontal axis
if we have 03 (like for example 03 or 43), we turn it 180 degrees to either side
the bitmap reflections with the river (the next two least significant bits) and the road (two more) are analogically encoded

-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- -------
Notes on defy declarations
{for starters, we actually have a def number in normal format}
The beginning of each segment with def are 4 bytes specifying the length of the name, followed by the name (with the extension),
followed by 42 bytes.

Here is a table with values.

Tabs separated columns.
The slashes '/' separate hex values ​​from decimal values ​​(I give values ​​including and including).
Decimal byte numbering.
The lists and notes I refer to are at the end of the file.

Byte Monsters Objects
defa name length (4 bytes, normal)
defa name
1 - 6 blockmap (see below)
7 - 12 visitmap (see below) - specifies the places where you can visit a given object (they are organized in the same way as a blobmap, with the only difference that the visited places are marked with a bit one, and the non-visiting places are marked with a bit zero)
13 - 14 bit field (9 bits; 8 in the first byte, 1 in the second) defining the area on which the object can be placed in the editor
15 - 16 bit field (9 bits; 8 in the first byte, 1 in the second) defining the terrain in the editor the object is in the menu
17 - 20 object type object type (list B)
21 - 24 subtype - list A subtype - list E | 0 // if there is no subtype then this is (00)
25 list in the editor with a given object (0- land, 1- cities, 2-monsters, 3- heroes, 4-artifacts, 5- resources)
26 (0/1) whether the object is "concave" (such as a pond with gems) - Objects that have this flag set will always be displayed POD on those that do not. ; additionally, I noticed that the shadows of objects with this flag are not displayed (maybe it's worth checking out)
27 - 42 only zeros, they seem to be responsible for nothing, maybe the developers have reserved them for unrealized features?
 
The first six bytes define the fields that are blocked by the building ('visitable' fields also count as blocking here).
Each of these bytes specifies a band of 8 (maybe only 7?) Horizontal, adjacent fields. The top bytes define the top lanes. If the object occupies less than 6 squares vertically, the upper ones remain unused (= marked as free = (FF)), the blockamap is in the lower ones.

To determine which fields in a given lane are blocked, write the value of the byte in a binary system, (if necessary) complete with insignificant zeros up to 8 characters, and reverse the order. The subsequent digits of the number obtained in this way will indicate which fields are blocked and which are not. 1 means an empty field, and 0 is taken.
For example, if an object takes a shape ('X' is an occupied space, and '.' Is an empty space):
XX.
XXX
.XX
It will be byte encoded:
1. (FF) -> bin 11111111 -> (we reverse) 11111111 -> ........
2. (FF) -> bin 11111111 -> (we reverse) 11111111 -> ........
3. (FF) -> bin 11111111 -> (we reverse) 11111111 -> ........
4. (9F) -> bin 10011111 -> (we reverse) 11111001 -> ..... XX.
5. (1F) -> bin 00011111 -> (we reverse) 11111000 -> ..... XXX
6. (3F) -> bin 00111111 -> (we reverse) 11111100 -> ...... XX
-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- -------
Notes about the heroes:
the hero takes 46 bytes by default (without changing the garrison, name, artifacts, etc.)
0001 - position along the x coordinate
0002 - position along the y coordinate
0003 - level (??)
0004 - always 02 (?)
000d - number (?) ---------------------
000e - always 0d (?) | These bytes specify |
000f - always cb (?) | Which bahater |
0010 - always 12 (?) --------------------- {used e.g. for missions}
0011 - player's number (player 1 - 0, 2 - 1 etc.)
0012 - hero type (e.g. Solmyr)
0013 - whether the first name is standard (00) or non-standard (01); if 01; are additional bytes: length: maximum 12 (in decimal), three zero bytes and first name; {ATTENTION! changing the name changes the header in a significant way (along with its length)}
0014 - whether the experience is non-zero; if so, four additional bytes - [0003] * 100 ^ 3 + [0002] * 100 ^ 2 + [0002] * 100 + [0000] = experience
0016 - Standard Skills (00) or Not (01)
if not, then 4 bytes for their number and their descriptions
0017 - garrison; 00 - standard, 01 - non-standard -> 28 additional bytes, 4 bytes per item, one or two first per monster type, the last two per amount - amount recording as in other cases of writing numbers
0018 - formation: loose - 00, strict - 01
0019 - whether the artifacts are standard (00) or non-standard (01); if not standard, this byte is followed by 40 additional bytes describing the artifacts
{the last two bytes are the number of artifacts in the pannier; if nonzero, then two extra bytes for each artifact in the pannier}
001a - patrol: FF - none, wpp. patrol radius
001b - hero's biography: 00 - missing, 01 - available, [extra bytes!]: 4 bytes per length (format as in the experiment) + content
001c - gender (?) - FF - standard, 00 - opposite
001d - standard spells (00) or non-standard spells (9 additional bytes right after this byte)
001e - 00 or 01; after 01, follow 4 additional bytes (the length of the hero's description grows to 50 characters) which means attack, defense, power and knowledge in turn; 00 means standard basic skills
still nothing but zeros
-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- -------
Notes about monsters
As a rule, a monster is 24 bytes
first four as each object (pos + def)
then 8 zeros
four bytes per type (probably a type, but it doesn't match anything else) {used e.g. for missions}
two bytes for the number of units in the open sky, 00 if random
one to define the character, 00 - the friendliest, 04 the most hostile
one to determine if there is a treasure / description
and if there is, an extra four bytes for the length of the message, some for the content of the message, 7 of 4 for the amount of resources and two for the artifact
one to determine if the unit never escapes (01) or is normal (00)
one to determine whether the number of units increases with time (00) or not (01) and bind in the dark
two are always zero
[PS: when is a monster 36 bytes ???]
-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- -------
Locks:
usually 48 bytes
00 - 02 - position
03 - def
04 - 0b - zero

11 - whether it has a non-standard name (then 01 instead of 00); if so, 4 bytes for length and name (additionally, it increases the length of the file)
12 - standard (00) or non-standard garrison (01)
if non-standard, then 28 additional bytes
seven times two bytes for the id of the creature and two for the number in normal notation, the order of the creatures as always
13 - loose (00) or strict (01) formation
14 - whether the standard settings of buildings (00) or not (01); if not, then an extra 12 bytes (note! you can also add the city event to the list below; it is fuller than this and seems to be compatible)
00 - 00; +1 if they have a city council, +2 if they have a town hall, +4 if they have a capitol, +8 if they have a fort, +16 if they have a citadel, +32 if they have a castle, +64 if they have a tavern, + 128 if it has a forge

07 // probably the same as in 01, except that it determines the unavailability of buildings
08 // probably the same as in 02 (checked for the sword brotherhood), except that it determines the unavailability of buildings
09 // probably the same as in 03, except that it determines the unavailability of buildings
0a // probably the same as in 04, except that it makes the buildings unavailable
0b - +1 if archanioys are not available (gen7 +)
{looks symmetrical so maybe it's better to do something else}
15 - has a fort (if 014 has a value of 00); if 014 is 01, this byte is treated as 0b of the building description
16 - 1e - which spells must appear in the guild

06 - whether the faction is random (00) or not (01)
07 - if the main lock has been selected for the player (01 - yes; 00 - no) - if yes, additional 5 bytes:

- 07 + 2 - apparently the type of city
- 07 + 3 - 07 + 5 - coordinates (standard - x, y, level)
08 - should I generate a random hero (to choose from at the start)? (check out)
09 - GrayFace's specification states that this is the hero number (what 'main' one to generate?), Taking FF when the hero is absent or random
[from what I can see it is the number of the main character]
0a - portrait of the main character (FF if standard)
0b - 0e - length of the main character's name in normal notation (+ hero's name, if any - shifts bytes)
- note - if the player does not have heroes, the description ends here -

10 - 13 - the number of heroes in the player
now as many times as the player has heroes repeats:
one byte for character type, four bytes for first name + first name if non-standard
